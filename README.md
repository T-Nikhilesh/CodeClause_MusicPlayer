# CodeClause_MusicPlayer
- To play music files, this Python script produces a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Music player using the Pygame and Tkinter modules.


- A GUI window shows a list of music files along with buttons for the corresponding actions, including play, pause, next, previous, add, and shuffle.

The music files are played by the programme using the Pygame mixer, and the graphical user interface is made via Tkinter. To load music files and shuffle the tracklist, it also makes use of the operating system's random libraries.

- Click the Browse button to view the music files.
- Play button -> The current tune in the list is played by the programme. 
- Pause button -> stops the song that is now playing. 
- Stop button: ends the song that is playing.
- The user can move to the next or previous track in the list using the next and previous buttons.
